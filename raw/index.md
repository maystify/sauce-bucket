# Sauce Bucket
A Lightweight, Easy Static Website Generator

# Why?
The purpose of this project was to make an easy way to convert a directory of markdown files to a directory of html files, as I didn't want to have to write out every single html page.

# The Future
Hopefully, I'll be able to soon implement a side bar that renders out a tree of all the different pages in this site.

# Demo
Currently, you're seeing a working demo of the project. Hopefully, as the projects progresses, this page's advancement will also increase.

# Directory
Check out a directory of pages [here](/directory.html)
