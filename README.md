# Sauce Bucket
A Lightweight, Easy Static Website Generator

# Why?
The purpose of this project was to make an easy way to convert a directory of markdown files to a directory of html files, as I didn't want to have to write out every single html page.

# Todo
[ ] Add more dynamics to the base model
[ ] Create a CLI accessible component of this package

# Demo
Check out this project's [website](https://alexwaitz.github.io/sauce-bucket/) that was generated with the project itself!
